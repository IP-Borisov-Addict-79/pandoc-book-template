# And now I will show you all the Quirks and Features:

- citeprocs doesn't like brackets and other special symbols in citation keys,
  the only one that works is colon

- no, we don't support arXiv citations :(

- `note` field type is not supported in any way :(

- `misc` entry type ignores `note` & `howpublished` fields, results look kinda
  ugly :(

- Following quirks seem to be a normal bibtex behaviour, but I don't
  remember to be honest:
  - you either have DOI or URL, not both; DOI always beats URL
  - DOI can be entered as a proper DOI number or as a full URL (i.e. as
    `https://doi.org/DOI-NUMBER`)
